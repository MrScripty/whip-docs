# Whip Docs - Architecture Overview

## Purpose

This document provides a high-level overview of the "Whip Docs" website architecture. The primary goal of this website is to host developer-facing documentation for the "Studio Whip" project. Currently, its main focus is presenting an interactive overview of Vulkan API components relevant to a 2D rendering context, and a module dependency graph for Rust projects. The site is designed for static hosting and includes a dynamic banner displaying recent Git commits and a code viewer panel.

## Core Components

*   **HTML Pages (`web-pages/`)**:
    *   `vulkan-overview.html`: The main interactive page displaying the Vulkan component tree and associated documentation.
    *   `module-graph.html`: Displays an interactive module dependency graph for Rust code, with a tree view for selected node interactions.
    *   `vulkan-engine.html`: A placeholder page for future engine-specific documentation.
    *   `index.html` (Root): Immediately redirects users to `web-pages/module-graph.html`.
    *   `web-pages/components/commit-banner.html`: HTML fragment for the Git commit banner, loaded dynamically.
    *   `web-pages/components/code-viewer.html`: HTML fragment for the pop-up code viewer panel, loaded dynamically.
*   **JavaScript**:
    *   `scripts/lists/tree.js` (formerly `script.js`): Contains the core logic for the interactive tree view on `vulkan-overview.html`. It handles fetching data, building the tree, managing UI state (selection, expansion, sticky headers, branch bar), and loading/displaying Markdown content.
    *   `scripts/graphs/module_dependency_graph.js`: Logic for rendering and interacting with the D3.js based module graph on `module-graph.html`. Sets a global variable `window.currentlySelectedGraphNodeData` upon node selection.
    *   `scripts/lists/graph_interaction_tree.js`: Logic for the tree view on `module-graph.html` that displays interactions for a selected graph node, triggered by `module_dependency_graph.js`.
    *   `scripts/ui/column-resizer.js`: Reusable script for draggable column resizing.
    *   `scripts/ui/commit-banner.js`: Fetches Git commit data from the GitHub API, loads `commit-banner.html`, and populates the banner on relevant pages. Implements drag-to-scroll.
    *   `scripts/ui/code-viewer.js`: Manages a pop-up panel to display source code fetched from GitHub, triggered by a hotkey when a node is selected in the module graph.
*   **CSS**:
    *   `web-pages/shared-styles.css`: Provides global layout, header styling, and base styles for content areas.
    *   Inline styles in `vulkan-overview.html` and `module-graph.html`: Define specific layouts and appearances for their respective views (tree, info panel, graph, etc.).
    *   `web-pages/components/commit-banner.css`: Styles for the Git commit banner.
    *   `web-pages/components/code-viewer.css`: Styles for the code viewer panel.
*   **Data Sources**:
    *   JSON (`whip-docs/trees/*.json`, e.g., `vulkan_2d_rendering.json`): Defines the hierarchical structure of the documentation tree for `vulkan-overview.html` and provides metadata.
    *   JSON (`rust-doc-tool/output/module_graph.json`): Provides node and edge data for the module dependency graph on `module-graph.html`. Generated by the `rust-doc-tool`.
    *   Markdown (`whip-docs/descriptions/*.md`): Contains detailed documentation content for individual components on `vulkan-overview.html`, loaded dynamically.
    *   GitHub API: Source for Git commit data displayed in the commit banner.
    *   GitHub Raw Content: Source for Rust file content displayed in the code viewer panel.

## Data Flow

1.  **Initial Load**:
    *   A user accessing the root `index.html` is redirected to `web-pages/module-graph.html`.
    *   Pages like `vulkan-overview.html` or `module-graph.html` load their respective HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2.  **Commit Banner Initialization (on `vulkan-overview.html`, `module-graph.html`)**:
    *   `scripts/ui/commit-banner.js` fetches `web-pages/components/commit-banner.html` and injects its content into a placeholder div.
    *   It then fetches the latest commit data from the GitHub API for "MrScripty/Studio-Whip".
    *   The script populates the banner with commit details (message, date, link).
3.  **Tree Initialization (`vulkan-overview.html`)**:
    *   `scripts/lists/tree.js`'s `DOMContentLoaded` listener triggers `loadAndRenderTree()`.
    *   `loadAndRenderTree()` fetches the specified JSON tree file (e.g., `vulkan_2d_rendering.json`).
    *   The script parses the JSON data and dynamically builds the HTML list structure for the tree.
    *   Event listeners are attached for selection and expansion. The info panel shows a default message until an item is selected.
4.  **Item Selection (`vulkan-overview.html`)**:
    *   When a user clicks a tree item, `scripts/lists/tree.js` updates UI highlights.
    *   It calls `loadDescription()` which fetches the corresponding Markdown file.
    *   Markdown is parsed (marked.js) and syntax-highlighted (highlight.js), then injected into the info panel.
    *   Metadata (tags, links) is displayed from the initial JSON.
5.  **Module Graph Initialization (`module-graph.html`)**:
    *   `scripts/graphs/module_dependency_graph.js` fetches `rust-doc-tool/output/module_graph.json`.
    *   It uses D3.js to render the graph of nodes (files/modules) and edges (interactions), applying clustering and force simulation for layout.
6.  **Graph Node Selection (`module-graph.html`)**:
    *   Clicking a node in the graph updates its visual state.
    *   `scripts/graphs/module_dependency_graph.js` sets `window.currentlySelectedGraphNodeData` with the selected node's data.
    *   It then calls `window.handleGraphNodeSelection(selectedNodeData, fullGraphData)` in `scripts/lists/graph_interaction_tree.js`.
    *   `graph_interaction_tree.js` filters the full graph data to find interactions related to the selected node.
    *   It then builds and displays a tree listing connected files and the nature of their interactions (e.g., "Uses: ItemX", "Provides: ItemY").
7.  **Code Viewer Activation (on `module-graph.html`)**:
    *   If a graph node is selected (`window.currentlySelectedGraphNodeData` is set), pressing '~' or '`' triggers `scripts/ui/code-viewer.js`.
    *   `code-viewer.js` initializes its panel if not already done by fetching `web-pages/components/code-viewer.html`.
    *   It constructs a GitHub raw content URL based on the selected node's ID (file path) and the repository's default branch.
    *   It fetches the Rust file content, syntax-highlights it using `highlight.js`, and displays it in the draggable panel.
    *   The 'Escape' key hides the panel.
8.  **UI Interactions (General)**:
    *   Tree toggles expand/collapse subtrees.
    *   Scrolling in tree columns updates sticky headers.
    *   Column dividers can be dragged to resize panels.
    *   Commit banner can be horizontally scrolled by dragging.
    *   Code viewer panel is draggable.

## Key Interactions

*   **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript heavily manipulates the DOM to build tree structures, render graphs, update styles, manage visibility, inject Markdown, and update UI elements like sticky headers, banners, and the code viewer.
*   **Data Fetching**: Uses the `fetch` API to asynchronously load JSON data, Markdown content, HTML fragments (for banner and code viewer), and external API data (GitHub commits, GitHub raw file content).
*   **Event Handling**: Listens for `DOMContentLoaded`, clicks, scroll events, window resize events, keydown events (for code viewer), and mousedown/mousemove/mouseup (for dragging columns, banner, code viewer).
*   **Global State/Callbacks**: `module_dependency_graph.js` uses `window.currentlySelectedGraphNodeData` to share the selected node's data with `code-viewer.js` and calls `window.handleGraphNodeSelection` in `graph_interaction_tree.js`.
*   **Library Usage**:
    *   `marked.js`: Markdown-to-HTML conversion.
    *   `highlight.js`: Syntax highlighting for Markdown code blocks and the code viewer.
    *   `d3.js`: SVG-based graph rendering and force simulation for the module dependency graph.

## Current Capabilities

*   **Redirection**: Root `index.html` redirects to the main module graph page (`web-pages/module-graph.html`).
*   **Interactive Tree View (Vulkan Overview)**: Displays hierarchical Vulkan components from JSON, allowing expansion/collapse and dynamic content loading.
*   **Interactive Module Graph (Module Graph)**: Displays a D3.js force-directed graph of Rust modules (from `module_graph.json`), showing dependencies, interaction types, and clustering by directory.
*   **Interaction Tree (Module Graph)**: Displays a tree of interactions (imports, module declarations) for a selected node in the module graph.
*   **Dynamic Content Loading**: Fetches and displays Markdown for Vulkan components; fetches and displays Rust source code from GitHub for the code viewer.
*   **Markdown Rendering & Syntax Highlighting**.
*   **Component Metadata Display (Vulkan Overview)**.
*   **Git Commit Banner**: Displays the latest commits from a specified GitHub repository, with drag-to-scroll functionality.
*   **Code Viewer Panel**: A draggable pop-up panel that displays syntax-highlighted source code of a selected Rust module from GitHub, triggered by a hotkey.
*   **UI Enhancements**:
    *   **Sticky Headers**: Show the path to currently visible tree items when scrolling (for both Vulkan overview and module graph interaction tree).
    *   **Branch Indicator Bar**: Visually indicates main tree branches (for both tree types).
    *   **Selection Highlighting**.
    *   **Resizable Columns**.

## Future Extensions

*   Addition of new documentation sections (e.g., Vulkan Engine details).
*   Implementation of search functionality.
*   Support for different documentation structures or types.

## Dependencies

*   **External Libraries (CDN)**:
    *   `marked.js`: Markdown parsing.
    *   `highlight.js` (and a theme CSS like `atom-one-dark.min.css`): Syntax highlighting.
    *   `d3.js`: Graph visualization.
*   **External APIs**:
    *   GitHub Commits API: For the commit banner.
    *   GitHub Raw Content URLs: For fetching source code in the code viewer.
    *   GitHub Repository API (briefly, to determine default branch for code viewer).
*   **Internal Data**:
    *   JSON files (`whip-docs/trees/`, `rust-doc-tool/output/`): Define tree structures, graph data, and component metadata.
    *   Markdown files (`whip-docs/descriptions/`): Provide component documentation content.
    *   HTML fragments (`web-pages/components/`): Reusable UI components (commit banner, code viewer).
*   **Development Tools (Not part of deployed website runtime, but crucial for data generation)**:
    *   `rust-doc-tool`: A Rust command-line application that analyzes a Rust project and generates `module_graph.json`.
    *   `utilities/generate_md_files.py`: Python script to scaffold Markdown description files.
    *   `utilities/prompt_tool.sh`: Shell script to aggregate project files for AI context.

## Notes

*   The website is designed as a static site, suitable for deployment on platforms like GitHub Pages.
*   Key paths and configurations are generally managed via constants in their respective JavaScript files.
*   The `rust-doc-tool` is essential for generating the data for the module dependency graph feature.
